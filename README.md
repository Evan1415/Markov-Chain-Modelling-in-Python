# An introduction to Python Programming using Markov Chain Modelling 

Here is a set of tutorials and accompanying notes that act as a self contained 
introduction to both Markov Chain Modelling and Python Programming. 

The introductory python notebook is very much a general introduction to python and 
is intended to be separate from the Markov Chain modelling side of things; so this 
could act as an ideal introduction to python programming, without the hassle of having 
to deal with Markov Chains - although these are worth knowing about, as they are used 
in a variety of different fields and the basic idea is always the same. 

The Markov Chain tutorials are moreso told through the story of solving different problems; the 
lecture notes and introductory python notebook are enough to tackle these, which is 
encouraged since this is how concepts are truly learned. So try and have a go without looking 
at the solutions first.
